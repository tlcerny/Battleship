Thomas and I did our initial user stories at the pub.  We found that our mains priorities was to make a simple battleship board, and be able to place ships.

We also noted that we will need to research networking so we can have to gui applications on two seperate computers.



Our main priority user stories were 

1. Generate Board
2. Create a ship class object: needs  to contain health and size
3. Need to be able to place ships on board-need a menu with it
	a. Valid spot checking needed
4.Game Start
	a. Player Turn
	b. Select Space
5. Dummy AI
	a.Static board
	b. Sequential spot selection
6. Investigate networking
7. Multiplayer
8. Look up interface(GUI)
9. sound
10. more robust AI 


We didnt' work together on the project during spring break, because Thomas was working and I was out of town.

Started working on the project on the Saturday before the project was due.  Because of this we just wanted to get a working copy.
We focused are project on this goal.


We got a working copy, with not very robust code and poor design, but our goal of getting a working copy was complete.
